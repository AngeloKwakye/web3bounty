# Pokémon Marketplace on Blockchain

## Overview

Welcome to the Pokémon Marketplace, a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to buy and collect Pokémon using blockchain technology. This project leverages Web3 and Chainlink to enable seamless cryptocurrency transactions. Users can browse through a collection of Pokémon and purchase them using various cryptocurrencies, including USD, BTC, and ETH. The real-time conversion rates are fetched using Chainlink's decentralized oracle network, ensuring transparency and accuracy in pricing.

## Features

   - **Real-time Conversion**: Prices are updated in real-time using Chainlink's price feeds, allowing users to see the exact cost of a Pokémon in their preferred cryptocurrency (USD, BTC, ETH).

### 2. **Blockchain Integration**
   - **Web3 and Ethereum**: The application is built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring all transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable.
   - **Smart Contracts**: All transactions are handled via smart contracts, ensuring automated and trustless payments.

### 3. **Chainlink Price Feeds**

### 4. **Responsive and User-Friendly Interface**
